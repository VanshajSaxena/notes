* Final keyword

  The `final` keyword in Java is a non-access modifier that can be applied to
  classes, methods, and variables. Its primary purpose is to *restrict*
  *modification*, *inheritance*, or *reassignment*.

** Key points for variables:

   - *Primitive types*: For final primitive variables, the value itself cannot be changed.
   - *Reference types*: For final reference variables, the reference itself
     cannot be changed to point to a different object. However, /the contents
   (state) of the object that the reference points to can be modified, unless
   the object itself is immutable./

** Key points for methods:

   When a method is declared as final, *it cannot be overridden by subclasses*. This
   is useful when you want to ensure that the implementation of a method remains
   consistent throughout the inheritance hierarchy.

** Key points for classes:

   When a class is declared as final, *it cannot be subclassed (inherited from)*.
   This means no other class can extend a final class.
