* Computer Networking

** Networking

   A network is simply a collection of computers, devices, and other resources connected together to exchange data.

** Data Communication

   Data Communication is the process of transmission of data between devices.

*** Analogue vs Digital Signals

    Data can be transmitted through electrical signals that are either analog (continuous) or digital (discrete). Most modern networks use digital signals.

*** Bandwidth

    Bandwidth refers to the capacity of a communication channel. The higher the bandwidth, larger the amount of data can be transmitted in the same time.

** Networking Protocols

   Protocols are a set of rules that govern how devices communicate over a network. These rules ensure that data is transmitted, received, and processed correctly between devices. Some key protocols are:

*** TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

    The foundation of the internet. It is a suite of protocols that enable communication between devices over the internet. TCP ensures that data is transmitted reliably, while IP is responsible for addressing and routing.

*** UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

    A simpler, connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery of data. It is used for applications where speed is more important than reliability.

*** HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

    The protocol used for transmitting web pages over the internet. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web.

*** FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

    A protocol used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network.

** Routing and Switching

*** Router

    A router connects different networks (like a home network to the internet) and directs data along the best available path. Routers use tables of IP addresses to figure out where data should go.

*** Switch

    A switch connects devices within a single network and forwards data only to the device it is intended for, based on MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.

*** Subnetting

    Subnetting involves breaking down large networks into smaller, manageable sub-networks, helping to optimize performance and security.

** Network security

*** Firewalls

    Firewalls control the incoming and outgoing traffic between a network and the internet, based on predefined security rules.

*** Encryptions [(see Cryptography)]{:$/programming-concepts/cryptography/cryptography-index:}

    Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format that can only be decrypted with the correct key. It ensures privacy and security for data in transit.

*** VPN (Virtual Private Network)

    A VPN allows users to connect to a network securely over the internet by creating a private, encrypted tunnel.
