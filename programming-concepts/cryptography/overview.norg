* Cryptography
  *Cryptography* is the science of secure communication. Its key ideas:

  - Confidentiality: Only authorized parties can read the data.
  - Integrity: Data is not altered during transmission.
  - Authentication: The identities of the parties are verified.
  - Non-repudiation: A sender cannot deny sending a message.

** Classical Cryptography
   Manual techniques of cryptography, which were used before the advent of
   computers. These include:
   - Substitution Ciphers
   - Transposition Ciphers These methods are now only of historical interest,
     these are not relevant today as these are easily broken.

** Modern Cryptography
   Modern cryptography leverages complex mathematical algorithms and computer
   power: Some notable types are:

*** Symmetric-Key Cryptography (Secret-Key Cryptography)
    The same key is used for encryption and decryption. Notable subtypes:

    - Block Ciphers: Encrypt data in fixed-size blocks. E.g. AES, DES.
    - Stream Ciphers: Encrypt data as continuous stream, one bit or a byte at a
      time. E.g. RC4 (Deprecated), Scala20.

    Key Challenge: Secure key distribution (both parties need the same secret
    key).

*** Asymmetric-Key Cryptography (Public-Key Cryptography)
    Uses a pair of keys - a public key (which anyone can know) and a private
    key (kept secret). Data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with
    the other. Subtypes/Examples:

**** Encryption Algorithms:
     - RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman): Based on the difficulty of factoring
       large numbers.
     - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): Based on the mathematics of elliptic
       curves.

**** Key Exchange Protocols:
     - Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Allows two parties to securely agree on a
       shared secret over an insecure channel.

    Advantages: Solves the key distribution problem inherent in symmetric
    cryptography. Application: Secure messaging digital certificates, and
    establishing encrypted connections (like TLS/SSL).

    Typically slower than symmetric encryption, which is why many systems use
    hybrid encryption (using asymmetric methods to securely exchange a
    symmetric key, then encrypting the bulk data with the symmetric cipher).

*** Cryptographic Hash Functions
    A hash function takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size
    string of bytes. The process is one-way - computing the hash is easy, but
    reversing it is computationally infeasible. Key properties:

    - Deterministic: The same input always produces the same hash.
    - Pre-image Resistance: Given a hash, it is hard to find the original
      input.
    - Collision Resistance: It should be hard to find two different inputs that
      produce the same hash.

    Examples: SHA-256, SHA-3. Applications: Data integrity checks, password
    storage, digital signatures, and blockchain.

*** Digital Signatures
    Digital signatures use asymmetric cryptography to provide a means of
    verifying the *authenticity* and *integrity* of a message, similar to a
    handwritten signature.

**** How it works
     ~ Hashing: The original message is hashed to create a digest.
     ~ Signing: The digest is encrypted with the sender's private key to
       produce the signature.
     ~ Verification: The recipient decrypts the signature using the sender's
       public key and compares the resulting digest with a newly computed hash
       of the received message.

    Examples: RSA Signatures, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), ECDSA
    (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). Applications: Secure
    communications, software distribution, and legal contracts.

*** Message Authentication Codecs (MACs)
    A MAC is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and
    ensure its integrity, using a secret key.

**** Difference from Digital Signatures
     MACs use symmetric keys and require both parties to share the same secret
     key, whereas digital signatures use asymmetric keys.

    Examples: HMAC (Hash-based MAC), CMAC (Cipher-based MAC). Applications:
    Verifying data integrity and authenticity in communications.
