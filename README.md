### Neorg

[Neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg) is a note-taking software that
works on `norg` filetype, which has an open-source specification. I found Neorg
to be really fitting my needs, so I use it to prepare notes for my studies and
learning.

### Reading

To read these notes (with proper rendering and parsing) you'll need to install
Neorg plugin for [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).
